//! Safe fee accumulation with overflow protection and automatic flush mechanism.
//!
//! This module provides robust fee management for the SwiftRemit contract,
//! preventing integer overflow through checked arithmetic and automatic flushing
//! when accumulated fees reach a threshold.
//!
//! # Fee Accumulation Safety
//!
//! The contract maintains a running total of collected fees (`total_fees`).
//! Over time with high transaction volume, this value can overflow, leading to:
//! - Incorrect accounting
//! - Potential exploits or contract failure
//!
//! This module addresses these risks through:
//! 1. Checked arithmetic for all fee additions
//! 2. A configurable maximum cap (MAX_FEES)
//! 3. Automatic flush mechanism that transfers fees to treasury when cap is reached
//! 4. Event logging for all flush operations
//! 5. Comprehensive edge case handling
